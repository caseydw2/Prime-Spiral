# Prime Spiral
`draw_spiral` creates a spiral of increasing integers, starting with 1 in the middle of the spiral. Natural numbers that are prime produce a white disc over their place in the spiral. This is what is known as an "Ulam spiral", or more colloquially a "Prime Sprial". More information on the spiral can be found on [its wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_spiral).

Inspiration of this project came from [this Numberphile video](https://youtu.be/iFuR97YcSLM). 

The spiral has the interesting property that the distribution of primes seem non-random. There are diagonal lines spread out through the spiral as the size of the spiral gets bigger.
